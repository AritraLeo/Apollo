This is a fun project which presents a score to a person based on his/her facial features. 

Disclaimer the application is completely made for entertainment purposes and not to harm someone's integrity.

Key points - 
1. The score is actually calculated keeping in mind the famous golden ratio which is a fraction.
2. It is roughly 1.62 and it is called the Golden Ratio of beauty! The Golden Ratio (also known as Phi, or the Fibonacci number) is the mathematical symmetry
algorithm that underlies our perception of attractiveness.
3. The score is calculated keeping in mind parameters like seperation between eyes, nose, mouth piece, etc.

So ya, what are you waiting for find your score and flex it !
